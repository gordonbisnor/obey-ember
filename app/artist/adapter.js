Growing up, Tee Cloud and Julien both learned from their fathers about singing. Tee Cloud has gone on to learn from and collaborate with George Paul, the famed Mi’kmaq songwriter who received The Mi’kmaq Honour Song during a 1980s sweat lodge. Naming the group out of their deep respect for the wolf, the duo have followed the pow wow trail throughout Mi’kma’ki since 2014. With stirring vocals and an unshakable rhythm, we couldn’t think of a better way to kick things off at this year’s convention.",

Over the last two decades, she’s become one of Halifax’s most in-demand and well-respected musicians, both as a soloist and educator. Her flourishing began with Gypsophila, a band that retired recently after a decade-long run replete with five releases, four ECMA wins and countless sold-out shows. As that project heads out to pasture, Gina’s career has kept busy with The Jerry Cans, a Juno-nominated, Iqaluit-based Arctic rock band. What’s more, Gina has her own solo project emerging: a striking new classical undertaking that combines heady minimalism with hints of klezmer and celtic influence. In partnership with The Fountain School Of Performing Arts, we’ve commissioned Gina to score an overture for this year’s festival. Featuring a string quartet led by Burgess and countertenor Andrew Pickett, her unique compositional voice will aid in unleashing this weekend of sonic wilding.",

Performing on the pipa, a traditional lute dating back over two-thousand years, Liu Fang demonstrates an intensity typified by the roots of her practice.

Employing gnarled industrial pulses, heavy power electronics, and unbridled vocal release, Chardiet envelops the audience into a heavy, collective energy. This energy/empathy has always been at the heart of Pharmakon’s ritualistic performances. With Contact, finally, Chardiet has created a body of work that reflects this exchange. As the adjoining artist statement insists: “When we pick up on transmissions between the private rooms inside our heads and the flesh of our vessels, when thought escapes its isolation and is seen, heard and understood. When our mind uses the body in order to transcend and escape it! The moments of connection/communion/CONTACT, when the veil is for a brief but glorious moment lifted, and we are free. Empathy!

Her recent work focuses on the function of music as understood in traditional societies: essential to settling common grounds and addressing relation. Inspired by Martinique thinker Édouard Glissant’s reflections on Creolization, Maviel entwins her work with the inextricable currents that move spaces and people between times and lands. Her solo performances are an effortless blend of genres and cultures, centering her stunning, exploratory vocal paths as they’re accompanied by tender surdo (Brazilian drum) and n’goni (West African harp). A creative force capable of assuaging pain and distance through deep, delicate sounding.",

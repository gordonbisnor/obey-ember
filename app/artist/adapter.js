    "description": "Having relocated to the remote locale of Crousetown, Nova Scotia in 2011 to escape Calgary’s developmental emptiness, improv/composition wiz Jay Crocker found himself sounding by his lonesome. The revered left-field player/producer/instrument-builder spent the first few years dislocated from his former music community toiling away in his home studio, creating new ways of creating. The results have been nothing short of startling so far. In 2015, Crocker released the wildly-inventive full-length MUUIXX under the moniker JOYFULTALK. Ostensibly a solo project fleshed out by Crocker’s modded, homebuilt instruments and bolstered live by multi-instrumentalist Dice Parks, JOYFULTALK combines micro-kraut, glitch-hop and tape-warmed ambience into an unparalleled universe of music. As part of OBEY X, we’re overjoyed to be premiering Crocker’s most-recent mindbender, The Bibelot. Part instrument, part installation, The Bibelot is a self-composing set of sixteen ceiling mounted music boxes with custom-built drives, loops, lights and amps. Creating a sanctuary space that reflects the natural constancy of change, The Bibelot represents a major achievement by one of our nation’s most exciting musical vanguards; a sonic portal of limitless combination that will slip you into the infinite now.",

    "description": "Easily one of the most unique, talked-about and mind-altering bands currently touring the international circuit, the Indonesian duo of Wukir Suryadi and Rully Shabara tend to leave both audiences and critics at a loss for how exactly to describe the group’s powerful, unprecedented music. Suryadi, the instrumentalist of the group, plays a bambuwukir, a kind of modified zither of his own invention that derives as much from traditional Javanese music as it does his own idiosyncratic practices. In the hands of Suryadi, the dynamic stringed instrument is manipulated feverishly, unleashing skittering runs, percussive booming and delicate thrums in turn.\n\nPerhaps even more dynamic is vocalist Rully Shabara. Transitioning between accomplished, operatic falsetto, frantic phonetic mumblings, laughter, throaty growls and piercing screams (often within a given composition) Shabara displays an unparalleled performativity tempered by fabulous sensibility. Working in such extremes, one may expect the music to be confrontational or thorny, but to Senyawa’s credit, the results are more often soulful and empowering.\n\n",
      "quote": "It’s safe to say there is no other band on the planet quite like Senyawa. What do you call the music of this Indonesian duo: folk? Doom metal? Unplugged minimalist noise improv? In fact, it is a little bit of each. - Pitchfork",

For Fisher, the power of music exceeds classification and genre, it finds root in the expression of the biological organism and its relationship to the greater universe/creation which is defined by vibrations. His contributions to labels such as Tzadik, Healing Power, Merge, Sub Pop and Inyrdisk among others span free jazz, psych-folk and the experimental edges of rock. His performance here in 20I5 as one half of cosmic duo Not The Wind Not The Flag was totally transforming, and we expect his solo outing to be much the same. In his own words: “Music can heal; serving as biofeedback to bring the organism back into balance/homeostasis”.",

Equally steeped in club culture and Latin American cumbia traditions, her work explores the historic roots of queer identity in conjunction with South American spirituality. Refusing to slot into a particular genre, her music has an eeire, untethered quality. Part think-piece, part body modifier, wrapped in jungle trance, chopped with pop-culture detritus, it is as seductive as it is unsettling.\n\nHer most recent releases include American Drift, a four-song suite that sonically excavates the Latinx experience from within a muddied West Virginian history, and last year’s unclassifiable, Elysia Crampton Presents: Demon City, an ‘epic poem’ inspired in part by Bartolina Sisa, an indigenous heroine who died opposing Spanish colonial powers in 18th-century Bolivia. Although Crampton’s work deals explicitly with weighty and complicated subject matter, her true talent rests in making highly visceral music felt first with the body, and later teased-out with an enlightened mind.",

    "description": "We’ve been hearing rave (like stark, raving) reviews about FET.NAT’s live shows for the past few years so we’re thrilled to be hosting them on their first tour of the East Coast. A central component of Hull’s much buzzed about E-Tron Records scene, the four-piece ensemble blends elements of post-punk, kraut, free-jazz and oddball humour into an infectious, off-kilter performance of mammoth proportions. Fronted by the charismatic JFNO, supported by the virtuosic Linsey Wellman (sax) and propelled by the deft rhythm duo of Pierre-Luc Clément (guitar + sampler) and Olivier Fairfield (drums), FET.NAT’s technical prowess finds a direct line into a bizarre, schizoid vision that is as sinister as it is playful. Something like Bon Cop Bad Cop: The Musical scored by Pere Ubu.",

    "description": "A vital emcee hailing from East Preston, MAJE blends bravado, beauty and civic pride with a keen ear for detail. Bar by bar, his narratives unfold with a butter-smooth inflection, shedding light into the folded corners of emotion. In the past two years, MAJE scooped up top prize in the Viola Desmond Songwriting Competition, received a nod for African Nova Scotian Music Association Rising Star and found himself a semi-finalist in CBC’s Searchlight contest. Using this momentum brilliantly, MAJE dropped Outhome in late 2016, a meditative short film that subtly recalibrates the East Coast hip-hop identity.",

    "name": "Laraaji",
    "description": "Born Edward Larry Gordon, this new age visionary came to prominence in the late 1970s after attracting the attention of ambient guru Brian Eno while busking in Washington Square Park. The fabled encounter led to Laraaji’s album-length contribution to Eno’s seminal Ambient Series, Ambient 3: Day of Radiance. With Eno behind the boards, Laraaji’s versatile, blissed-out approach to zither playing reached new heights and, at the same time, ears around the world.\n\nIn the decades since, Laraaji has maintained an emphatic international following. Having released countless trance-inducing recordings, and led concerts and meditation workshops the world over, his work is revered for its ability to inspire a unique lightness of spirit. More recently, portions of his immense back catalogue have seen renewed interest thanks to reissues from major tastemaker labels including Soul Jazz, Light In The Attic, Stone’s Throw subsidiary Leaving Records and Eno’s imprint All Saints.\n\nHis compositions move effortlessly between soothing dronescapes, invigorating minimalism and celestial ambience. Ever a force of positivity, we feel absolutely blessed to be hosting this legendary beacon.",

    "name": "Kara-Lis Coverdale",
    "description": "Referred to as “one of the most interesting composers in North America” by The Guardian, Kara-Lis Coverdale is a national treasure working on an international scale at the intersections of electronic composition and new classical. She creates dense, colourful arrangements that blur the line between human touch and data stacking. With a unique penchant for long-form melody, harmony, and sonic detail, her work is nuanced and sumptuous.\n\nA classically trained pianist, a scholar with a focus on sculpted realisms in recorded music, and a go-to collaborator for noisenik Tim Hecker, Coverdale’s output showcases a considered approach and whipsmart sensibility through and through. At this year’s Convention, she’ll be mounting a piece for solo piano entitled PICL (Pieces In Caps Lock) that ‘offers an essential narrative on the limitations of mediation, the capabilities of touch, and the immense consequences of either embracing of overcoming instrumental change’.",

    "description": "Julie Matson has been soothing audiences through transformative performances for the past five years. The Montreal-based, Vancouver-bred composer showcases a great sophistication in blending gentle analog tones with clever conceptual underpinnings. The resulting work is a wonderfully understated marvel, as Matson stretches slight melodies into tonal universes. While the mood can prove liminal and ghostly, Matson’s genuine engagement is ever apparent and pervasive. High quality deep listening from the Jeunesse Cosmique crew.",
